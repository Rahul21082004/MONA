# MONA: Multi-owner Data Sharing from Dynamic Group in the Cloud

## Abstract
The major aim of this project is to develop a secure multi-owner data sharing scheme that allows any user in the group to securely share data with others through an untrusted cloud. This scheme supports dynamic groups efficiently, enabling new users to decrypt data files uploaded before their participation without needing to contact data owners. User revocation is managed through a novel revocation list without updating the secret keys of remaining users. The size and computation overhead of encryption remain constant and independent of the number of revoked users. Our approach provides secure and privacy-preserving access control, allowing group members to anonymously utilize cloud resources. Additionally, the real identities of data owners can be revealed by the group manager in case of disputes. We provide rigorous security analysis and extensive simulations to demonstrate the efficiency of our scheme in terms of storage and computation overhead.

## Introduction
Cloud computing provides an economical and efficient solution for sharing group resources among cloud users. However, sharing data in a multi-owner manner while preserving data and identity privacy from an untrusted cloud is a challenging issue due to the frequent change of membership. MONA addresses these challenges by offering a secure and dynamic data sharing scheme that ensures data integrity, confidentiality, and efficient user management.

## Features
- **Secure Multi-owner Data Sharing**: Allows any group member to securely share data with others.
- **Dynamic Group Support**: New users can decrypt previously uploaded data without contacting data owners.
- **Efficient User Revocation**: Manages user revocation through a revocation list without updating remaining users' keys.
- **Constant Encryption Overhead**: The size and computation overhead of encryption are constant and independent of the number of revoked users.
- **Privacy-preserving Access Control**: Ensures anonymous utilization of cloud resources by group members.
- **Identity Reveal**: Group manager can reveal real identities of data owners in case of disputes.
- **Security Analysis and Simulations**: Provides rigorous security analysis and extensive simulations to demonstrate efficiency.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language used.
- **Cryptographic Libraries**: For implementing encryption and decryption mechanisms.
- **Cloud Services**: For data storage and sharing.
- **Simulation Tools**: For performing security analysis and efficiency demonstrations.

## Setup Instructions
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MONA.git
    cd MONA
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage
1. **Initialize the system**: Follow the prompts to set up initial configurations and user groups.
2. **Add Users**: Add new users to the group dynamically.
3. **Upload and Share Data**: Upload data files to the cloud and share them securely with group members.
4. **Revoke Users**: Manage user revocation without affecting remaining users.
5. **Access Control**: Utilize the privacy-preserving access control to manage group resource usage.
